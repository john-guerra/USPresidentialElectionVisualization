        h2.title How did Americans vote in the 2020 Presidential Election?
        p This is an analysis of the voting in the counties of the United States in the 2020 presidential election.
        p Scroll down to continue.

      section.step
        h2.title Let's visualize the results!
        p But how? Maybe with a map of the United States...

      section.step
        h2.title Let's add colors
        p We can use colors to differentiate who won in each state. If a state voted mostly for #[span.colorDemocrat Democrats] it will be #[span.colorDemocrat blue], if it voted mostly for #[span.colorRepublican Republicans] it will be #[span.colorRepublican red].

      section.step
        h2.title So is the US really that red?
        p One of the problems with this graphic is that it does not show the individual results of the counties.

      section.step
        h2.title Results by county
        p By counties the result is different, but also misleading, for several reasons...

      section.step
        h2.title Geographic area is misleading
        p For example, even though #[span#exampleLeft] and #[span#exampleRight] have similar opposing results percent wise, they are very different in terms of population (#[span#exampleLeftPopulation] vs #[span#exampleRightPopulation]). 

      section.step
        h2.title Use color shades
        p Let's add a scale where darker colors represent higher differences, and lighter colors represent smaller differences.

      section.step
        h2.title What about the number of voters?
        p Another problem with this map is that it shows the results by geographic area, and for example, rural counties have a lot of area but a small population.

      section.step
        h2.title A circle for each county
        p Let's replace each county with a circle of the same size to make a more accurate visual comparison.

      section.step
        h2.title They don't fit!
        p Another problem, the circles appear on top of each other ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è...

      section.step
        h2.title Respect my bubble!
        p Let's add a repulsion force that makes each circle try to avoid being on top of another.

      section.step
        h2.title But what about the number of voters?
        p We still have the problem that all circles are the same size ‚òπÔ∏è. How about we use the size of the circle...

      section.step
        h2.title Size matters (in this case)
        p How about we use the #[strong area] (not the radius) of the circles to represent the total number of voters.

      section.step
        h2.title Details
        p If you want to know the values of each county, move the mouse over the center of the circle.

      section.step
        h2.title Now we can compare
        p With this map it is a bit easier to see how the country voted.

      section.step
        h2.title Patterns by regions
        p For example, it can be seen how counties near the border with Mexico voted more for #[span.colorDemocrat Democrats], and how in the Midwest more for #[span.colorRepublican Republicans].

      section.step
        h2.title Is this true for the entire region?
        p With the map it is not so easy to know. (In reality, maps are not the best way to visualize data for most tasks üòâ).

      section.step
        h2.title Let's remove the map then...
        p Now we have more space to use. But the counties are still located by geographic position, which is no longer necessary.

      section.step
        h2.title All to the center
        p Removing the geographic location allows us to use the location to encode more information. For example, horizontally by their result.

      section.step
        h2.title From left to right
        p To differentiate the counties more easily, we can distribute them horizontally by how they voted. We send to the #[span.colorDemocrat left] those who voted more for #[span.colorDemocrat Democrats] and to the #[span.colorRepublican right] those who voted more for #[span.colorRepublican Republicans].

      section.step
        h2.title What about the vertical location?
        p We can use it to divide by regions.

      section.step
        h2.title Voting by Regions
        p This graphic shows us how each region of the United States voted. Here we can observe, for example, how the West Coast voted more for #[span.colorDemocrat Democrats], versus regions more in the center and south of the country, which voted more for #[span.colorRepublican Republicans]. This allows for easier comparison and understanding of the final election results.

      section.step
        h2.title Voting by population
        p We can also change the vertical position to encode the number of voters by population.
