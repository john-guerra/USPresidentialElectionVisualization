        h2.title How did Americans vote in the #[span.yearValue] Presidential Election?
        p This is an analysis of the voting in the counties of the United States in the presidential #[span.yearValue] election.
        strong Scroll down to continue.

      section.step
        h2.title Let's visualize the results!
        p But how? Maybe with a map of the United States...

      section.step
        h2.title Let's add colors
        p We can use colors to differentiate who won in each state. If a state voted mostly for #[span.colorDemocrat Democrats] it will be #[span.colorDemocrat blue], if it voted mostly for #[span.colorRepublican Republicans] it will be #[span.colorRepublican red].

      section.step
        h2.title So is the US really that red?
        p One of the problems with this graphic is that it does not show the individual results of the counties.

      section.step
        h2.title Results by county
        p By counties the result is different, but also misleading, but it is still far from accurate as it doesn't represent the actual percentage of votes...

      section.step
        h2.title Let's use color saturation
        p Let's add a scale where darker colors represent higher differences, and lighter colors represent smaller differences. However, this is still misleading...


      section.step
        h2.title Geographic area is misleading
        p For example, even though #[span#exampleLeft] and #[span#exampleRight] have similar opposing results percent wise, they are very different in terms of population (#[span#exampleLeftPopulation] vs #[span#exampleRightPopulation]).


      section.step
        h2.title What about the number of voters?
        p Another problem with this map is that it shows the results by geographic area, and for example, rural counties have a lot of area but a small population.

      section.step
        h2.title A circle for each county
        p Let's replace each county with a circle of the same size to make a more accurate visual comparison.

      section.step
        h2.title They don't fit!
        p Another problem, the circles appear on top of each other ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è...

      section.step
        h2.title Respect my bubble!
        p Let's add a repulsion force that makes each circle try to avoid being on top of another.

      section.step
        h2.title But what about the number of voters?
        p We still have the problem that all circles are the same size ‚òπÔ∏è. How about we use the size of the circle...

      section.step
        h2.title Size matters (in this case)
        p How about we use the #[strong area] (not the radius) of the circles to represent the total number of voters.

      section.step
        h2.title Details
        p If you want to know the values of each county, move the mouse over the center of the circle.

      section.step
        h2.title Now we can compare better
        p With this map it is a bit easier to see how the country voted.

      section.step
        h2.title Patterns by regions
        p For example, it can be seen how larger counties and near the coast tend to vote more for #[span.colorDemocrat Democrats], while interior counties for #[span.colorRepublican Republicans].

      section.step
        h2.title What about the overall result?
        p With the map it is not so easy to know. (In reality, maps are not the best way to visualize data for most analysis tasks üòâ).

      section.step
        h2.title Let's remove the map then...
        p Now we have more space to use. But the counties are still located by geographic position, which is no longer necessary.

      section.step
        h2.title Everyone to the middle
        p Removing the geographic position allows us to use the location to encode more information. For example, we can place counties horizontally depending on who the voted more towards...

      section.step
        h2.title From left to right
        p To differentiate the counties more easily, we can distribute them horizontally by how they voted. We send to the #[span.colorDemocrat left] those who voted more for #[span.colorDemocrat Democrats] and to the #[span.colorRepublican right] those who voted more for #[span.colorRepublican Republicans].

      section.step
        h2.title What about the vertical location?
        p We can use it to divide by regions.

      section.step
        h2.title Voting by Regions
        p This graphic shows us how each region of the United States voted. Here we can observe, for example, how the New England region tends to vote more for #[span.colorDemocrat Democrats], versus East South Central which voted more for #[span.colorRepublican Republicans]. This allows for easier comparison and understanding of the final election results.

      section.step
        h2.title Voting by population
        p We can also change the vertical position to encode the number of voters by population.
